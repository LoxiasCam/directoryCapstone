# St. Isatis, a directory of courses

![screenshot](imgs/screenshot.jpg)

This is a concept project for a virtual directory of courses with three pages:

- the main page (search page), with a link to the results page
- the search results page, with a list of schools each with a link to the detail school page
- the detail and sign-up school page

This project was done using the design idea by [Mathew Njuguna and others on Behance](https://www.behance.net/mathewnjuguna) as inspiration and as an outline on how to style the general elements in the page.
